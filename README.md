# UnscentedKalmanFilterProject
Unscented Kalman Filter Project for Udacity Self-Driving Car course

This was my submission to Project 3 in Term 2 of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Course. I have two versions, the one in src uses more of a pure function approach, and the one in src-b4 is before I went all in on pure functions. I didn't quite take it as far as I perhaps should have and might clean it up more in the future.

Also, I might want to revisit this to use an EKF for Lidar, while leaving the Radar with UKF.
